    "# SQL for Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is rarely handed to you in a perfect CSV file. In the real world, it lives in **Relational Databases**. To get this data, you need to speak the database's language: **SQL** (Structured Query Language).\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a database as a collection of Excel sheets (called \"tables\") that are linked together. SQL lets you ask questions like \"Give me all customers who live in Vienna\" or \"Calculate the average sales for last month.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "- **Understand SQL Basics**: Learn the core commands `SELECT` (to pick columns) and `WHERE` (to filter rows).\n",
    "- **Connect with Python**: Use the `sqlite3` library to talk to a database from your Python code.\n",
    "- **Load into Pandas**: The ultimate goal—getting the data out of the database and into a Pandas DataFrame so you can analyze it."
