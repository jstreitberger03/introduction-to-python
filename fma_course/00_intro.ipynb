    "# Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a widely used high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**History**\n",
    "- Developed by **Guido van Rossum** in the late 1980s (first released in 1991).\n",
    "- Named after the British comedy group **Monty Python**.\n",
    "- We are using **Python 3**, the current major version.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fun Facts**\n",
    "- **Antigravity**: If you type `import antigravity` in Python, it opens a web comic about Python.\n",
    "- **The Zen of Python**: Type `import this` to see the guiding principles of Python (e.g., \"Beautiful is better than ugly\").\n",
    "- **Space Exploration**: Python plays a key role in processing data from the James Webb Space Telescope and was used in the first image of a black hole!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics**\n",
    "- **Interpreted**: Code is executed line-by-line, making it easy to test and debug.\n",
    "- **High-level**: Handles complex details (like memory management) automatically.\n",
    "- **General-purpose**: Used for web development, data science, automation, AI, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "- **Easy to Learn**: Syntax resembles English.\n",
    "- **Huge Ecosystem**: Thousands of libraries for every task (e.g., `pandas` for data, `matplotlib` for plotting).\n",
    "- **Free & Open Source**: No license fees.\n",
    "- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "- **Speed**: Slower than compiled languages like C++ (though libraries like `numpy` mitigate this).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why for FMA?\n",
    "- **Data Analysis**: Efficiently process large datasets (Excel, CSV).\n",
    "- **Automation**: Automate repetitive reporting and file management tasks.\n",
    "- **Text Processing**: Analyze legal documents and contracts."

    "## Working on JupyterHub\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using a **JupyterHub Server**. This means Python runs on a central server, and you access it via your web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up your Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure your project has its own isolated space for libraries (and doesn't conflict with others), we use a **Virtual Environment**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-Step Setup:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Open a Terminal**:\n",
    "    - In the JupyterHub interface (Launcher), click on **Terminal**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Create the Virtual Environment**:\n",
    "    - Run the following command to create a hidden folder named `.venv`:\n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "      python3 -m venv .venv\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Activate the Environment**:\n",
    "    - Tell the terminal to use this environment:\n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "      source .venv/bin/activate\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "    - You should see `(.venv)` appear at the start of your command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Install Required Packages**:\n",
    "    - Install the libraries we will use in this course:\n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "      pip install ipykernel pandas matplotlib\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Register the Kernel**:\n",
    "    - Make this environment available as a \"Kernel\" in your notebooks:\n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "      python -m ipykernel install --user --name=fma_course --display-name \"Python (FMA Course)\"\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Select the Kernel**:\n",
    "    - In this notebook, look at the top right corner.\n",
    "    - Click on the kernel name (e.g., \"Python 3\").\n",
    "    - Select **Python (FMA Course)** from the list."
